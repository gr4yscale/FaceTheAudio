What is this nonsense?

It's just a quick prototype of controlling audio playback rate (In this case Bulgarian Language Lessons) based on how open your mouth is.

Is it useful? Probably not.

Uses the fantastic [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker) and [ofxAudioUnit](https://github.com/admsyn/ofxAudioUnit) addons for OpenFrameworks.

Audio Units are very powerful, and it's great to see audio code in openframeworks as so many people use it for graphics.
